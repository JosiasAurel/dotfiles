# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Import additional configuration files

# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
# TERM variable
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
#TERM: alacritty
window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. Both lines and columns
  # must be non-zero for this to take effect. The number of columns must be at
  # least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will fall back
  # to the window manager's recommended size

  # Window padding (changes require restart)

  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
